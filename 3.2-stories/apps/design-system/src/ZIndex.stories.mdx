# Z-index scale

```scss
@use "@codely/design-system/src/settings/zindex";
```

We have a z-index scale to position elements in the page. These are private variables:

```
$_1: 1;
$_2: 2;
$_3: 3;
$_4: 4;
$_5: 5;
$_6: 6;
$_7: 7;
$_8: 8;
$_9: 9;
$_10: 10;
```

To position a new element, create a new public variable and add it in the scale, such as:

```
$header: $_8;
$modal: $_9;
```
